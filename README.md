# R_scripts
R script files with annotated sample code for working with data in R.
Download the script file and use it in R studio to take advantage of R Studio's helpful indexing, which allows you to rapidly jump between sections marked using #section_name####.
These scripts are frequently being updated as I develop my R skills, so come back for the latest version if you find them helpful.
A script for machine learning methods is currently in development and will be added when ready.
